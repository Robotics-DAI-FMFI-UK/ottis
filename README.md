# ottis
This repository contains our code for a modified Ottis robot.

Ottis robot has been developed by Eduardo. There is a instructables page:
https://www.instructables.com/Ottis-Robot-the-Arduino-Robot-That-Can-Walk-and-Pe
and a neat YT video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Kt6kMrS9pQ

We have also modified the body - mostly head, since we use different electronics:

Arduino nano strong, which is very convenient for connecting servos
and Arduino nano for second controller responsible for controlling display and
other electronics.
